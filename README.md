# cs2d-battle-royale

The Battle Royale (PUBG) mod for CS2D.

This mod used to be a private mod that I (alongside another developer) has worked on for the Steam release of CS2D. It is not uploaded to Unreal Software. This repository does not include any assets (assets that are mentioned in the config), as I do not own these. I decided to release this repository to public, because I have no other use for it. The mod was developed around the end of 2017.
